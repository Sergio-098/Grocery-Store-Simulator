# Grocery-Store-Simulator
Optimization of grocery store checkout lines
Through Python and PyCharm I created a program that takes multiple configurations of a grocery store's checkout sections (differing numbers of regular, express, and self-serve checkout lanes as well as their capacities) and then simulates a series of events to occur in the checkout area. The program keeps track of total time elapsed, total number of customers, and largest wait time for a single customer and returns the optimal checkout section configuration.
